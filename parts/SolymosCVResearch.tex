\section{Research interests and goals}

I am an ecologist with a research focus on 
developing and applying state-of-the-art 
computational techniques for big data sets to better 
inform conservation and management of many species over large spatial scales.
My research interests range widely in terms of taxonomic groups 
(molluscs, birds, arthropods, and vascular plants),
and spatial scales (microhabitats, local, regional, continental, global).
